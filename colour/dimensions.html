<p>Before you choose a colour, consider its properties.</p>

<h4>Value</h4>
<p>How do we distinguish between colours? If we can't, then meaning, symbolism, emotion, all becomes irrelevant. To create distinction, value plays the most important role.</p>

</p>Let’s start with Black and White. Black and white are colours. But unlike other colours, black and white don’t have chroma or hue(we'll come to that later), and hence they are called achromatic colours. Objects that appear to emit or reflect a great deal of light, relative to other objects, appear white. Objects that appear to emit or reflect very little light, relative to other objects, appear black. In between these extremes are greys, and they too are achromatic. Though in the real world, it is rare to see an achromatic grey since they have an undertone of some colour in them. But for the sake of our understanding, let's begin with achromatic colours, i.e. black, white and greys.

<figcaption>
The greyscale has darkness increasing on a linear scale.</figcaption>
</section>

</p>For example, in the above scale, the intensity of blackness (darkness) is linear, i.e. it is increasing with a constant of one value from one slice to the next. However, we notice a clear difference between the first two boxes but not thereafter. In other words, the perceived difference diminishes as the actual intensity increases. This is the Weber-Fechner law.</p>

<figcaption>
The greyscale has darkness increasing on a logarithmic scale.</figcaption>
</section>

</p>Our perception to see from light to dark is non-linear. So, if we apply a logarithmic scale to the increase in intensity, it is easier to detect the degree of brightness/darkness. This lightness/brightness, the variation in the colour from dark to light, or vice-versa, is called <em>Value.</em></p>

                        </figure>
<figcaption>
The regions marked A and B are the same shade of grey.</figcaption>

</p>Black is not strictly the absence of light. However, an object that doesn’t reflect any light will be black. In the same way, white is not a fixed condition but a relative one. What appears white in one context may appear grey in another. For this reason, white, black, and lightness are relative terms, depending on light, surroundings, or surface</p>

<h4>Hue</h4>
<p><em>Hues</em> are colours. Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow are considered unique hues, i.e. they appear pure; other colors always appear as combinations of these unique hues. Please focus on the term “appear” here, we are talking about perception, not about pigments, wavelengths, or colour mixing systems.</p>

Unique Hues.</figcaption>
</section>

</p>When we see colour, we notice hue first, but it is not what we see best. If we rely on hue alone to create contrast, the visibility will become fragile. When two colours become indistinguishable in greyscale, their difference depends primarily on hue. That difference may not survive changes in context, such as scale, lighting, medium, or adjacency.</p>

<figure>

                        </figure>
<figcaption>
Hues Scales across Values.</figcaption>

</p>Although the eye may register hue first, it registers value differences before hue differences. This is especially true at small sizes, low contrast, or under imperfect viewing conditions. Visibility depends on perceived difference, not technical difference. If a colour’s visibility relies on subtle perceptual effects, it becomes unstable. If colour is the only carrier of information, exclusion is built into the design.</p>

 <figure>

                        </figure>
<figcaption>
If we turn all the Colours to Black and White, we can still distinguish between the Values.</figcaption>



<h4>Chroma</h4>
<p><em>Chroma</em> describes how far a colour departs from a neutral grey of the same value within a defined colour system. The visual strength of a colour. In the colour order system  by Albert H. Munsell, chroma is treated as a measurable dimension, independent of hue and value. As per the Munsell system, each colour may have more or less chroma, hence shows us how all colours are not equal in their intensity.
</p>

                        </figure>
<figcaption>
The Munsell Chroma chart shows uneven lengths because colours vary in strength. For example, Red can get more intense than Green or Blue</figcaption>
<p>Chroma and saturation are often used interchangeably in everyday language and software tools. They have subtle differences though. Whilst Chroma refers to the independent colour property of objects; saturation describes light sources. The same colour can appear more or less saturated depending on surrounding colours, lighting conditions or material and medium. Though they both describe how much a colour could get intense, i.e. how far are they from neutral grey.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Juxtapositions</h4>
<p>Now that we understand the three properties of colour. Let's try and see how colours are perceived in different positions.</p>
 <figure>
                            <img src="images/colours/munsell-atlas-17.jpg" alt="Chroma">
                        </figure>
<figcaption>
The yellow hue is stronger at lighter value whereas purple-blue is stronger at darker value</figcaption>
<p>If we take just two hues and observe them across a range of values and chroma, we'll see that different colours reach their maximum intensity at different value levels. In the chart above, Yellow becomes most intense at lighter values, while purple–blue reaches greater intensity at darker values. These are inherent properties of the colour. Perhaps the best way to verify this is to look beyond colour systems and observe how colour behaves in nature. Sunlight, shadows, foliage, soil, sky. Again and again, we find the same tendencies at work.</p>
 <figure>
                            <img src="images/colours/munsell-atlas-11.jpg" alt="Chroma">
                        </figure>
<figcaption>
On the left the primary hues are stronger at darker value, on the right, the middle hues grow stronger at lighter value.</figcaption>
<p>Not all “vivid” colours compete the same way. Some hues announce themselves even at moderate chroma, while others require much higher chroma to feel equally present. This means that a colour can dominate a composition not because it is more saturated, but because its hue reaches perceptual intensity more easily at a given value.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Recap</h4>

<p>To remember the three properties of colour easily, follow this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Hue is another term of colour. Red and green are different hues.</li>
    <li>Value is how light or dark a colour can get, i.e., how much white colour is added to that colour. The more the white, the lighter the value.</li>
    <li>If Value is based on adding white, Chroma(or Saturation) is about adding grey. The more grey you add to a colour, the less intense it gets.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>Hue: colour</li>
    <li>Value: lighter or darker</li>
    <li>Chroma(or Saturation): duller or stronger</li>
</ol>

<p>There are other colour terms such as tints, shades, tones, bright, muted etc. They are confusing. The best way to understand colours is through Hue, Value and Chroma.</p>

<p>There are also warm and cool colours, but that too is not a well-defined characteristic of colour. Though, we'll cover it in the "Context" chapter.</p>

<hr>



<p>Now that we understand all the three dimensions, let's understand how we perceive them.</p>

<p>A colour is never seen on its own. It is always seen against something else. The below exercises demonstrates that appearance can change without changing the colour itself. In all three examples, the inner squares are identical, only the surrounding context changes. What shifts is the perceived hue, the perceived value or the perceived saturation. Exercises like these echo the work of Josef Albers, who demonstrated that colour is not fixed but relational. Rather than teaching colour theory, he asked students to observe what colour does under changing conditions. The goal here is the same.
